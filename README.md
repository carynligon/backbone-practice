# Notes before using app:
- PASSWORDS ARE NOT SECURE, this app is only for practice and does not store password properly, only use generic passwords such as "password", "123", etc. when poking around
- The "liked" feature is not up and running yet. You will eventually be able to "like" posts and save them to a certain category. On your liked page, you will be able to sort by category and view the list of those posts.
- If you have not registered, you will need to do that before being routed to the posts page (you can skip this step by changing the hash to #read if you'd like)
